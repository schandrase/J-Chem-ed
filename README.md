# J-Chem-ed SARS-CoV-2 Data
Welcome to surya lab. With respect to ongoing pandemic, we have done a small research work related to spike protein RBD domain conformational dynamics. In the prefusion state, the S-protein’s RBD domains alternate between open (‘up’) and closed (‘down’) conformation. Studying the conformational dynamics is crucial to understand the binding and fusion into human cell. Only the open RBD conformation can bind with human ACE2 protein. Here we studied the specific heat capacity by molecular dynamics simulation. The specific heat capacity realtes the conformational dynamics of the proteins in our case opena nd closed. The study can lead to two outcomes first 

The open and close protein systems of spike protein PDBid: 6VSB and 6VXX are taken from COVID-19 archieve. The system file is downloadable from CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 archive: Fully-glycosylated S protein head-only models

Here we have provided the system file and last 100 ns of the molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. All the simulation is performed using open source software; VMD, NAMD and chimera X. 

The simulation data is available in zenodo repository. 

The complete tutorial is available in SI of chemrxiv:
