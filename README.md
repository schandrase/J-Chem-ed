# J-Chem-ed SARS-CoV-2 Data
Welcome to surya lab. With respect to ongoing pandemic, we have done a small research work related to spike protein RBD domain conformational dynamics. The prefusion state, the S-protein’s RBD domains alternate between open (‘up’) and closed (‘down’) conformation. Studying the conformational dynamics is crucial to understand the binding and fusion into human cell. Only the open RBD conformation can bind with human ACE2 protein. Here we have provided the system file and last 100 ns of the molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. All the simulation is performed using open source software; VMD, NAMD and chimera X. 

The system file is downloadable from CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 archive: Fully-glycosylated S protein head-only models

The open and close protein systems of spike protein PDBid: 6VSB and 6VXX are taken from COVID-19 archieve. For clarity we have also provided in our folder here too. Since NAMD requires PDB and PSF file for simulation we have used the setup file from CHARMM-GUI as is it is. IF your a GROMACS or other simulation software person you can get appropriate files from the same archieve.
